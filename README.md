Overview:
The JavaScript Snake Game is a web-based rendition of the classic snake game, designed to run seamlessly in any modern web browser. The game utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity.

Gameplay Mechanics:
Movement: Players control the snake using the arrow keys (or WASD keys). The snake moves continuously in the direction of the last key pressed.
Growth: The snake grows longer each time it eats a food item, and the player’s score increases accordingly.
Objective: The goal is to achieve the highest score by consuming food items and avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake’s own body.

Features:
Simple Controls:
Intuitive keyboard controls make the game easy to play for users of all ages.
Real-Time Scoring:
The current score is displayed in real-time, updating each time the snake eats a food item.
Game Over Detection:
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, and the player is given an option to restart the game.

Development Details:
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the game, including the game canvas and score display.
CSS: Styles the game elements for a visually appealing interface, including the snake, food, and game area.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including movement, collision detection, and score updates. The game loop is managed using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.

User Interface:
Main Game Area: A canvas element where the snake and food are rendered.
